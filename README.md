# AHK_Autoclicker_v2
An enhancement of my previous autoclicker. 

Also unbannable using decreasing random intervals meaning slower to faster. This autoclicker works when you hold down the left mouse button and/or the right mouse button. Press 'f' to disable/enable left autoclick, 'g' to disable/enable right autoclick. Reaches around 20cps. Only works on lunar client (Only activates once focused on lunar client).
